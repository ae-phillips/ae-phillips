## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Anna Phillips -- I graduated Summa Cum Laude in May, 2025, from the University of Richmond, with my B.A. in Psychology and minors in Music and Data Science & Statistics. I'm a member of Phi Beta Kappa and Psi Chi.

My interest in Data Science began with a Data Visualization elective within my Psychology major. That class was my first introduction to R (and coding in general), and I was immediately hooked on the interplay of logic and creativity. There's bias in every level of data: how you collect it, how you clean it, how you analyze it, how you visualize it, and how you disseminate it.
