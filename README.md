## Hello! üëã
### About Me: 
My name is Anna Phillips ‚Äî I graduated Summa Cum Laude in May, 2025, from the University of Richmond, with my B.A. in Psychology and minors in Music and Data Science/Statistics. I'm a member of Phi Beta Kappa and Psi Chi. 

My interest in Data Science began with a Data Visualization elective within my Psychology major. That class was my first introduction to R (and coding in general), and I was immediately hooked on the interplay of logic and creativity. 

### My Data Science Framework:
There's bias in every level of data: how you collect it, how you clean it, how you analyze it, how you visualize it, and how you disseminate it. Understanding these biases is essential to challenging existing power structures and systems that use data for infinite profit and growth, rather than for the optimization of social good. 

My previous data science education drew heavily from concepts in Dr. Catherine D'Ignazio and Dr. Lauren F. Klein's book [*Data Feminism*](https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/4660/Data-Feminism), and moving forward, I hope to continually challenge the alleged "objectivity" in data, specifically in this current rise of AI. Humans are biased, and we are the ones who control our data ‚Äî we must take accountability for that.

### My Skills:
R: Data cleaning, analysis, and visualization; R Markdown; Key packages: the tidyverse, ggplot, tidytext, and mapping.

Python: Just beginner level for now (CMSC 150), but I'm excited to transition into using it for data science, including analysis and visualization.

### Past Projects:
*‚ÄúLove‚Äù in Stephen Sondheim‚Äôs lyrical corpus: An exploration with tf-idf, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling*
