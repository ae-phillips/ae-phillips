## Hello! 👋
### About me: 
My name is Anna Phillips —— I graduated Summa Cum Laude in May, 2025, from the University of Richmond, with my B.A. in Psychology and minors in Music and Data Science/Statistics. I'm a member of Phi Beta Kappa and Psi Chi.

My interest in Data Science began with a Data Visualization elective within my Psychology major. That class was my first introduction to R (and coding in general), and I was immediately hooked on the interplay of logic and creativity. There's bias in every level of data: how you collect it, how you clean it, how you analyze it, how you visualize it, and how you disseminate it. Understanding these biases is essential to challenging existing power structures and systems that use data for infinite profit and growth, rather than for the optimization of social good. My data science framework draws heavily from Dr. Catherine D'Ignazio and Dr. Lauren F. Klein's book [*Data Feminism*](https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/4660/Data-Feminism).
